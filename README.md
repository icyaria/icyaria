### Welcome to my GitHub! 🌱

My name is Maria and I'm a B.Sc. student at the [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications](https://www.di.uoa.gr/) of [NKUA](https://en.uoa.gr/).

I'm currently trying to build a strong foundation in the tech world while taking my first steps in Cybersecurity.

As an intern at [IPTO](https://www.admie.gr/en), I focus on OT threat detection and security but in my free time, I trade screens for trails, mountains and adventures! ⛺🎒🌄
